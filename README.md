## Contact
Feel free to contact me about job opportunities. If you did this by raising an issue, that would be even cooler.

My current job, despite how good it is for personal development,  autonomy and salary, is being relocated. I'm interested in finding a suitable replacement in either here in London, or in Vancouver to tickle my adventuring gene.

All the relevant information is here. Build my CV or read the latest build yourself, and check github for my latest activity :)
