Personal resume, occasionally updated. Now uses HTML5 technologies instead of LaTeX for ease of maintanance. Stashed here as weak self advertising.

## Usage
If you feel I should be exploring new horizons with YOURCOMPANY, send me an email.

My current job is great for personal development, autonomy, and occasional remote deployment. Lenient attitudes toward these are a must, as are contributing to open source projects.

Locations considered are primarily in England and Norway.
